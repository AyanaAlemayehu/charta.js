- Inspired by Sticky Notes application on Mac. Can this library offer the handiness of Sticky Notes, but at the same time store all data securely?
- Auto-saving feature would be important.
  - _concerning the Cloud Storage Feature_ I think using the [Google Cloud Storage API](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/apis) would be a good route to go for you. Its free! It has a [javascript library that helps in implementation](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-storage) and because something else deals with the cloud storage concept, it could potentially save a lot of time on your end. There are a couple problems though, such as the need to connect a bank account to your google developer console account thing (i promise its free) and other setup things that may make automating/codefying this bit into a library more tricky. Any questions with using google API's you can send my way!
  - I'm learning how to work with databases and could collaborate with you in the future!! I am hoping that my JS library helps in the construction of a webserver, and I am trying to make it streamline the connection process to databases. I am learning more, but I am happy to talk with you about it. – Ryan
- This library could be integrated into web conferencing software, learning platforms, browsers...
  - Yes! You could implement this with web browsers. Specifically, have you thought of creating a google chrome extension? I believe they are made just using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Given that you seem to be comfortable in the languages above (your code looks great!), this may be something you could explore. You can read more about chrome extensions [here](https://www.sitepoint.com/create-chrome-extension-10-minutes-flat/). – Ryan
- Please add more of your thoughts!
- Ideas:
  - A visual timeline with previous versions of a note
  - Simple style/theme/color templates
  - "Drawing notes" using your mouse
  - Ability to stack notes
  - Password-locked notes
  - Import/export of notes (by sharing files or through cloud)
  - Send notes, possibly via email? – Ryan
  - Export notes to some file (perhaps: PDF, TXT, Markdown) – Ryan
  - Option to create an account to sync notes. This would also tie into storing notes. – Ryan
